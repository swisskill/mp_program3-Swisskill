# Program # 3

## Course: 
Cosc 4730

## Name: 
Will Brant

## Description: (how to run the program, phone/emulator screen size, android version ie 11)
- Standard calculator; Works just like the windows calculator. (-) means negate, ^ is power, . is put in a decimal place. If you hit equal twice in a row, it resets to zero. Clear will completely clean the screen. Either way can be used to delete
- I'm not quite sure where to find it in the settings, but a quick google search tells me that a moto g power 2021 has a resolution of 720x1600 pixels, 20:9 ratio
- Android version 11
## Anything that doesn't work:
- It doesn't work if you flip it to the side. No need to flip it to the side.
