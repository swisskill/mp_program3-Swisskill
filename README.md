# Program # 3

## Course: 
Cosc 4730

## Name: 
Will Brant

## Description: (how to run the program, phone/emulator screen size, android version ie 11)
- Standard calculator; Works just like the windows calculator. (-) means negate, ^ is power, . is put in a decimal place, C is clear. If you hit equal twice in a row, it resets to zero. Clear will completely clean the screen. Either way can be used to delete. Also, I have button that says hello. I just wanted an even number of buttons
- I'm not quite sure where to find it in the settings, but a quick google search tells me that a moto g power 2021 has a resolution of 720x1600 pixels, 20:9 ratio
- Android version 11
## Anything that doesn't work:
- You can't switch to landscape mode. I made it that way on purpose
